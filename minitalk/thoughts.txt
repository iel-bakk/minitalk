so as i give my client the servers pid and the message to send, it has to first :
    initialise the sigaction struct by:
        --> Delevering the handler to the struct
        --> setting up the sigaction struct's set_mask with sigemptyset()
        --> adding the flags to the set
    After this, we reach the pid check phase :
        --> by sending the signal 0 to the pid that we got from our params
        -->
